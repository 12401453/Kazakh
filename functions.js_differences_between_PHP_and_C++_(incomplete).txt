1.) in fetchMultiwordData(), the array of adjacent_toknos given back by the server is quoted string in the PHP version ("[4,23,12345,45,32]" etc.), which means it is only interpreted by JavaScript as an Array if its firsted put through JSON.parse. This is due to using PHP's json_encode() function to form the JSON string, which I need for the character-escaping purposes; the C++ JSON is formed by hand so I can choose to omit the quotes around the array.
